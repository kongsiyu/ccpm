# Epic Start

Launch parallel agents to work on epic tasks in a shared branch.

## Usage
```
/pm:epic-start <epic_name>
```

## Quick Check

Run preflight checks:
```bash
!bash ccpm/scripts/pm/epic-start/preflight-checks.sh "$ARGUMENTS"
```

## Instructions

### 1. Create or Enter Branch

Follow `/rules/branch-operations.md`:

```bash
!bash ccpm/scripts/pm/epic-start/manage-branch.sh "$ARGUMENTS"
```

### 2. Identify Ready Issues

Read all task files in `.claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/`:
- Parse frontmatter for `status`, `depends_on`, `parallel` fields
- Check GitHub issue status if needed
- Build dependency graph

Categorize issues:
- **Ready**: No unmet dependencies, not started
- **Blocked**: Has unmet dependencies
- **In Progress**: Already being worked on
- **Complete**: Finished

### 3. Analyze Ready Issues

For each ready issue without analysis:
```bash
# Check for analysis (replace {issue} with actual issue number)
!bash ccpm/scripts/pm/epic-start/check-analysis.sh "$ARGUMENTS" "{issue}"
```

### 4. Launch Parallel Agents

For each ready issue with analysis:

```markdown
## Starting Issue #{issue}: {title}

Reading analysis...
Found {count} parallel streams:
  - Stream A: {description} (Agent-{id})
  - Stream B: {description} (Agent-{id})

Launching agents in branch: epic/$ARGUMENTS
```

Use Task tool to launch each stream:
```yaml
Task:
  description: "Issue #{issue} Stream {X}"
  subagent_type: "{agent_type}"
  prompt: |
    Working in branch: epic/$ARGUMENTS
    Issue: #{issue} - {title}
    Stream: {stream_name}

    Your scope:
    - Files: {file_patterns}
    - Work: {stream_description}

    Read full requirements from:
    - .claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/{task_file}
    - .claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/{issue}-analysis.md

    Follow coordination rules in /rules/agent-coordination.md

    Commit frequently with message format:
    "Issue #{issue}: {specific change}"

    Update progress in:
    .claude/epics/$ARGUMENTS/updates/{issue}/stream-{X}.md
```

### 5. Track Active Agents

Create/update execution status file:
```bash
!bash ccpm/scripts/pm/epic-start/create-execution-status.sh "$ARGUMENTS"
```

### 6. Monitor and Coordinate

Set up monitoring:
```bash
!bash ccpm/scripts/pm/epic-start/setup-monitoring.sh "$ARGUMENTS"
```

### 7. Handle Dependencies

As agents complete streams:
- Check if any blocked issues are now ready
- Launch new agents for newly-ready work
- Update execution-status.md

## Output Format

```
üöÄ Epic Execution Started: $ARGUMENTS

Branch: epic/$ARGUMENTS

Launching {total} agents across {issue_count} issues:

Issue #1234: Database Schema
  ‚îú‚îÄ Stream A: Schema creation (Agent-1) ‚úì Started
  ‚îî‚îÄ Stream B: Migrations (Agent-2) ‚úì Started

Issue #1235: API Endpoints
  ‚îú‚îÄ Stream A: User endpoints (Agent-3) ‚úì Started
  ‚îú‚îÄ Stream B: Post endpoints (Agent-4) ‚úì Started
  ‚îî‚îÄ Stream C: Tests (Agent-5) ‚è∏ Waiting for A & B

Blocked Issues (2):
  - #1236: UI Components (depends on #1234)
  - #1237: Integration (depends on #1235, #1236)

Monitor with: /pm:epic-status $ARGUMENTS
```

## Error Handling

If agent launch fails:
```
‚ùå Failed to start Agent-{id}
  Issue: #{issue}
  Stream: {stream}
  Error: {reason}

Continue with other agents? (yes/no)
```

If uncommitted changes are found:
```
‚ùå You have uncommitted changes. Please commit or stash them before starting an epic.

To commit changes:
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your commit message"

To stash changes:
  git stash push -m "Work in progress"
  # (Later restore with: git stash pop)
```

If branch creation fails:
```
‚ùå Cannot create branch
  {git error message}

Try: git branch -d epic/$ARGUMENTS
Or: Check existing branches with: git branch -a
```

## Important Notes

- Follow `/rules/branch-operations.md` for git operations
- Follow `/rules/agent-coordination.md` for parallel work
- Agents work in the SAME branch (not separate branches)
- Maximum parallel agents should be reasonable (e.g., 5-10)
- Monitor system resources if launching many agents
