# PRD: Multi-Language Support for CCPM

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the implementation of multi-language support for the Claude Code Project Management (CCPM) system, starting with Chinese language support to better serve Chinese users. The solution will maintain full English compatibility while providing a foundation for future language expansions.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- CCPM is designed as a single-language (English) system
- All documentation, prompts, and agent instructions are in English
- Chinese users face language barriers when adopting the workflow
- Missing market opportunity in Chinese-speaking regions

**Problem:**
CCPM's English-only design limits adoption among Chinese developers and teams, creating unnecessary friction for a significant user base that could benefit from the structured workflow approach.

**Why Important Now:**
- Growing Claude Code adoption in Chinese developer communities
- Feedback from Chinese users requesting localized documentation
- Opportunity to establish CCPM as the standard for international teams

## User Stories

### Primary Personas

**Chinese Developer (Primary)**
- Professional developer in China/Taiwan/Hong Kong
- Comfortable with English code but prefers native language for documentation
- Needs clear setup instructions and workflow guidance in Chinese

**International Team Lead (Secondary)**
- Manages multi-cultural development teams
- Needs consistent workflow that supports team members' language preferences
- Values maintaining English as technical standard while supporting local languages

### User Journeys

**Chinese Developer Onboarding:**
1. Discovers CCPM through Chinese developer community
2. Finds Chinese README with clear setup instructions
3. Follows Chinese documentation to understand workflow
4. Successfully implements CCPM with Chinese-language agent prompts
5. Shares positive experience with Chinese developer network

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Chinese README is complete and accurate
- Setup process works identically to English version
- Agent prompts produce Chinese responses when requested
- User can switch between language versions easily

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1: Chinese Documentation**
- Complete Chinese translation of README.md → README_ZH.md
- Maintain identical structure and information depth
- Include language switcher links in both versions
- Ensure all commands and examples work identically

**FR2: Global Language Configuration System**
- Create `.claude/rules/language-config.md` for centralized language rules
- Update `.claude/CLAUDE.md` template with language preferences integration
- Leverage existing rules system for minimal code changes
- Ensure language settings propagate through `/re-init` command

**FR3: Command Language Support**
- Add language rule references to key PM commands (prd-new, prd-parse, epic-*)
- Commands automatically inherit language preferences from global rules
- No need to modify individual command logic - use rule inclusion system

**FR4: Agent Language Integration**
- Agents read language preferences from global rules
- Chinese responses maintain technical accuracy
- Preserve all functionality while supporting Chinese output
- Language preference flows through agent coordination system

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**
- No performance impact on English users
- Language selection should not add system overhead
- Documentation loading time remains unchanged

**Compatibility**
- 100% backward compatibility with existing English workflows
- All existing commands work without modification
- No breaking changes to current functionality

**Maintainability**
- Translation updates should be straightforward
- New language additions should follow established pattern
- Clear separation between language-specific and universal content

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
- Chinese README completion rate: 100% feature parity with English
- User adoption: Track GitHub traffic from Chinese regions
- Community feedback: Positive sentiment in Chinese developer communities

### Qualitative Measures
- Chinese users can complete full CCPM setup without language barriers
- Agent interactions produce natural, accurate Chinese responses
- Documentation feels native, not machine-translated
- Future language additions follow established patterns

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Constraints**
- Must maintain English as default/fallback language
- No modification to core CCPM functionality
- File-based approach (no database or complex i18n framework)
- Compatible with existing GitHub Pages deployment
- **Fork Maintenance**: Minimize changes to reduce conflicts when syncing upstream

**Resource Constraints**
- AI-assisted translation (no professional translation budget)
- Limited ongoing maintenance resources
- Must be simple enough for single maintainer
- **Fork-specific**: Changes must be easy to reapply after upstream merges

**Timeline Constraints**
- Initial Chinese support within current development cycle
- Future language additions as community demand emerges

**Assumptions**
- Chinese is the highest priority non-English language
- Rules-based approach provides sufficient centralization
- Existing `.claude/rules/` pattern can handle language configuration
- Language rules will be inherited by all commands automatically

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT Building:**
- Dynamic language switching within CLI tools
- Translation of code comments or variable names
- Real-time translation services
- User preference persistence across sessions
- Complex i18n framework integration
- Translation of generated GitHub issues/comments
- Localized date/time formatting beyond documentation

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies**
- AI translation quality for technical content
- Community feedback for translation accuracy
- GitHub Pages support for multiple documentation files

**Internal Dependencies**
- Current documentation structure remains stable
- Agent prompt architecture supports language parameters
- Existing build/deployment process accommodates new files

**Assumptions About Dependencies**
- Claude's Chinese language capabilities are sufficient for technical translation
- Current markdown-based documentation approach will continue
- No major restructuring of agent system planned

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Minimal-Change Chinese Support (MVP)
- Create `.claude/rules/language-config.md` (NEW FILE)
- Update `.claude/CLAUDE.md` template with language integration (MODIFY)
- Create `README_ZH.md` Chinese translation (NEW FILE)
- Add language rule references to 3-4 key PM commands (MINIMAL MODIFY)

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Future)
- Additional documentation files translation
- Refined agent prompt optimization
- Community feedback integration

### Phase 3: Expansion (Future)
- Additional languages following established pattern
- Standardized language addition process

## Technical Approach

**Minimal File Changes (Fork-Friendly):**
```
# NEW FILES (no conflicts with upstream)
├── README_ZH.md                           # Chinese README
├── .claude/rules/language-config.md       # Language rules

# MODIFIED FILES (minimal changes)
├── .claude/CLAUDE.md                      # Add language integration
├── .claude/commands/pm/prd-new.md         # Add language rule reference
├── .claude/commands/pm/prd-parse.md       # Add language rule reference
└── .claude/commands/pm/epic-decompose.md  # Add language rule reference
```

**Rules-Based Language Configuration:**
- Language preferences defined in `.claude/rules/language-config.md`
- Commands include rule via: `- .claude/rules/language-config.md`
- Global settings propagate through existing `/re-init` mechanism
- No modification to command logic - pure configuration approach

**Fork Maintenance Strategy:**
- New files won't conflict with upstream merges
- Modified files have minimal, localized changes
- Language configuration is self-contained in rules
- Easy to reapply changes after upstream sync

This PRD provides a clear roadmap for implementing multi-language support while maintaining the simplicity and effectiveness that makes CCPM valuable to development teams.
