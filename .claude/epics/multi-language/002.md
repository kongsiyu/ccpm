# Task: Translate README to Chinese

## Description

Create a comprehensive Chinese translation of README.md as README_ZH.md, maintaining identical structure and information depth. Include bidirectional language switcher navigation to enable seamless switching between English and Chinese versions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Complete translation of README.md content to Chinese
- [x] Maintain identical section structure and organization
- [x] Preserve all technical accuracy and depth of information
- [x] Add language switcher links in both English and Chinese README files
- [x] Ensure all commands and examples work identically
- [x] Validate that Chinese content feels natural, not machine-translated
- [x] Include proper Chinese technical terminology

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**:
  - AI-assisted translation using Claude's Chinese capabilities
  - Manual review and refinement for technical accuracy
  - Add navigation headers for language switching
- **Key considerations**:
  - Maintain consistent technical terminology
  - Preserve markdown formatting and structure
  - Ensure all links and references work correctly
  - Cultural adaptation where appropriate without losing technical meaning
- **Code locations/files affected**:
  - `README_ZH.md` (new file)
  - `README.md` (minor addition for language switcher)

## Dependencies

- [ ] No blocking dependencies - can work in parallel with rule creation
- [ ] Optional: Language config rules for reference (Task 001)

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: true (mostly independent, minimal README.md modification)

## Definition of Done

- [x] README_ZH.md created with complete Chinese translation
- [x] All sections translated accurately and naturally
- [x] Language switcher added to both README.md and README_ZH.md
- [x] Technical commands and examples verified to work
- [x] Links and references updated for Chinese version
- [x] Content reviewed for cultural appropriateness
- [x] File formatting and markdown structure preserved
