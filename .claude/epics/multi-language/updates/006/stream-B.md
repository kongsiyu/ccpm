# Stream B: Language Inheritance Validation

## Scope
Test global inheritance across commands and agent interactions

## Files
- `.claude/rules/language-config.md`
- Various command execution tests
- Agent interaction validation

## Progress
- ‚úÖ Tested `/re-init` command language propagation mechanism
- ‚úÖ Validated language inheritance across PM commands
- ‚úÖ Tested agent interactions with Chinese language settings
- ‚úÖ Verified persistence across command execution sequences
- ‚úÖ Tested edge cases (partial configuration, missing sections)

## Test Results

### `/re-init` Command Testing
- **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Finding**: The `/re-init` command successfully propagates language settings from `.claude/CLAUDE.md` to `CLAUDE.md`
- **Validation**: Language configuration section is properly copied with all references intact

### Language Inheritance Across PM Commands
- **Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Finding**: Shell scripts (`.claude/scripts/pm/*.sh`) output in English and do not inherit Chinese language settings
- **Evidence**:
  - `status.sh` outputs "üìä Project Status" instead of "üìä È°πÁõÆÁä∂ÊÄÅ"
  - `help.sh` outputs all help text in English
- **Root Cause**: Shell scripts do not reference or implement language configuration rules

### Agent Interactions Language Testing
- **Status**: ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Finding**: Agent responses are in English despite Chinese being configured as primary language
- **Evidence**: All agent responses during testing were in English
- **Root Cause**: Agents are not currently reading or applying language configuration from `CLAUDE.md` or `.claude/rules/language-config.md`

### Persistence Testing
- **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Finding**: Language configuration persists correctly across command executions
- **Validation**: Configuration remains stable after multiple operations

### Edge Case Testing
- **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Finding**: System correctly detects and handles partial/malformed configurations
- **Evidence**:
  - When language-config.md was partially completed, CLAUDE.md updated to show warnings
  - System listed specific missing sections
  - Provided clear restoration instructions
  - Automatically restored full configuration when source file was complete

## Key Findings

### What Works
1. **Configuration Propagation**: `/re-init` correctly copies language settings
2. **Edge Case Handling**: System gracefully handles partial configurations
3. **Configuration Persistence**: Settings remain stable across operations
4. **Error Detection**: Missing sections are properly identified and reported

### What Needs Implementation
1. **Shell Script Localization**: PM command scripts need Chinese output implementation
2. **Agent Language Application**: Agents need to read and apply language rules
3. **Global Inheritance Mechanism**: Commands need to automatically inherit language settings

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Update shell scripts in `.claude/scripts/pm/` to support Chinese output
2. Implement language rule reading in agent interactions
3. Add language inheritance mechanism to command execution

### Implementation Strategy
- Shell scripts should read language preference from `.claude/rules/language-config.md`
- Commands should include language-config.md in their rule references
- Agents should check CLAUDE.md for language configuration during initialization
