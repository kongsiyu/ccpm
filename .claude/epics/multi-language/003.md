# Task: Update Global Template Integration

## Description

Update the `.claude/CLAUDE.md` template to include language rule references, enabling automatic inheritance of language preferences across all commands and agents. This creates the global configuration mechanism that makes language settings available system-wide.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Update `.claude/CLAUDE.md` to include reference to language-config rules
- [x] Ensure language configuration propagates through `/re-init` command
- [x] Maintain existing CLAUDE.md functionality unchanged
- [x] Add clear documentation about language configuration
- [x] Test that language settings are inherited by all commands
- [x] Verify global language preference works across sessions

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**:
  - Add rule reference to existing `.claude/CLAUDE.md` template
  - Follow established patterns for rule inclusion
  - Ensure seamless integration with existing configuration
- **Key considerations**:
  - Must not break existing functionality
  - Should integrate naturally with current CLAUDE.md structure
  - Language rules must be accessible to all commands and agents
  - Changes should be minimal and focused
- **Code locations/files affected**: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (modification)

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 001: Language configuration rules must be created first
- [ ] Existing CLAUDE.md template structure must remain stable

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 1-2 hours
- Parallel: false (depends on language rules being created)

## Definition of Done

- [x] `.claude/CLAUDE.md` updated with language rule reference
- [x] Language configuration accessible through global template
- [x] `/re-init` command propagates language settings
- [x] No regression in existing CLAUDE.md functionality
- [x] Global language inheritance working correctly
- [x] Documentation updated to explain language configuration
- [x] Changes tested and validated
