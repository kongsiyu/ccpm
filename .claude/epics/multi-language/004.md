# Task: Implement Agent Language Support

## Description

Ensure that all CCPM agents automatically read and respond according to global language preferences from the rule system. Implement Chinese response capabilities while maintaining technical accuracy and preserving fallback to English for technical terms.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Agents automatically detect language preference from global rules
- [x] Chinese responses maintain technical accuracy and natural language flow
- [x] Fallback mechanism to English for unsupported technical terms
- [x] All existing agent functionality preserved in both languages
- [x] Agent responses feel natural, not machine-translated
- [x] Consistent terminology across all agents

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**:
  - Leverage existing global rule inheritance system
  - No modification to individual agent files needed
  - Test agent responses in Chinese language context
  - Validate technical accuracy of translations
- **Key considerations**:
  - Must maintain backward compatibility with English
  - Chinese responses should be professional and accurate
  - Technical terms may require English fallback
  - Agent coordination should work in both languages
- **Code locations/files affected**: No direct file modifications (uses global inheritance)

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 001: Language configuration rules must exist
- [ ] Task 003: Global template integration must be complete
- [ ] Existing agent architecture must support rule inheritance

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 3-4 hours
- Parallel: false (requires foundation tasks to be complete)

## Definition of Done

- [x] All agents respond appropriately to Chinese language configuration
- [x] Chinese responses are technically accurate and natural
- [x] English fallback works for unsupported scenarios
- [x] Agent coordination system works in both languages
- [x] No regression in English functionality
- [x] Consistent technical terminology maintained
- [x] Response quality validated across different agent types
