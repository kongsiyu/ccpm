# Task: Validate Complete Chinese Workflow

## Description

Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the complete CCPM workflow in Chinese language mode. Validate that all functionality works identically to English version, refine translations based on testing results, and ensure the user experience is seamless for Chinese developers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete CCPM workflow tested using only Chinese documentation
- [ ] All PM commands produce appropriate Chinese responses
- [ ] Navigation between language versions works bidirectionally
- [ ] Agent interactions are natural and technically accurate
- [ ] Performance matches English version (no degradation)
- [ ] Translation quality meets professional standards
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios handled appropriately

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**:
  - End-to-end workflow testing from setup to completion
  - Test all major PM command sequences
  - Validate agent responses across different scenarios
  - Performance benchmarking against English version
- **Key considerations**:
  - Must achieve 100% feature parity with English
  - Focus on user experience from Chinese developer perspective
  - Identify and fix any translation or functionality issues
  - Document any limitations or fallback scenarios
- **Code locations/files affected**: Potential refinements to all translated content

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 001: Language rules foundation
- [ ] Task 002: Chinese documentation complete
- [ ] Task 003: Global template integration working
- [ ] Task 004: Agent language support implemented

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 4-5 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all other tasks to be complete)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Full CCPM workflow tested successfully in Chinese
- [ ] All commands work with appropriate Chinese responses
- [ ] Language switcher navigation validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Translation quality reviewed and refined
- [ ] Edge cases and error handling verified
