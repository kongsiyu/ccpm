# Task: Create Language Configuration Rules

## Description

Create the foundational language configuration system by implementing `.claude/rules/language-config.md`. This file will serve as the centralized language configuration that all commands and agents inherit from through the existing CCPM rules system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `.claude/rules/language-config.md` with comprehensive language configuration
- [ ] Define default language preference structure
- [ ] Include Chinese language configuration with appropriate prompts
- [ ] Ensure configuration is compatible with existing rule inclusion system
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for unsupported scenarios
- [ ] Document configuration options and usage patterns

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**: Create new rule file following existing CCPM rule patterns
- **Key considerations**:
  - Must integrate seamlessly with existing `.claude/rules/` system
  - Should provide clear language preference mechanism
  - Include both user-facing and agent-facing language settings
- **Code locations/files affected**: `.claude/rules/language-config.md` (new file)

## Dependencies

- [ ] No external dependencies - can start immediately
- [ ] Requires understanding of existing CCPM rule system patterns

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: true (independent task, no conflicts)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Language config rule file created and properly formatted
- [ ] Configuration includes both English (default) and Chinese settings
- [ ] Rule follows CCPM conventions and patterns
- [ ] Documentation within rule explains usage
- [ ] File can be referenced by other rules and commands
- [ ] Tested locally to ensure proper formatting
