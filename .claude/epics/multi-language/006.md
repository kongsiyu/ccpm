# Task: Test Configuration Deployment and Inheritance

## Description

Validate that the `/re-init` propagation mechanism works correctly and that global language inheritance functions as designed. Ensure language settings persist across command executions and that the configuration deployment is robust and reliable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `/re-init` command properly propagates language settings
- [x] Language preferences persist across multiple command executions
- [x] Global inheritance works for all commands without individual modifications
- [x] Configuration deployment is reliable and consistent
- [x] Settings survive session restarts appropriately
- [x] Future language additions can follow the same pattern

## Technical Details

- **Implementation approach**:
  - Test `/re-init` command with language configuration
  - Validate persistence across different command sequences
  - Verify global inheritance mechanism works as designed
  - Test edge cases like partial configurations or missing files
- **Key considerations**:
  - Must validate the core architectural assumption of global inheritance
  - Ensure robustness of configuration deployment mechanism
  - Test that future languages can be added using same pattern
  - Verify no commands require individual modification
- **Code locations/files affected**: Testing existing mechanism, no new code

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 003: Global template integration must be implemented
- [ ] Existing `/re-init` command must be functional

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 2-3 hours
- Parallel: true (can run alongside other testing once template integration is done)

## Definition of Done

- [x] `/re-init` propagation tested and working correctly
- [x] Language inheritance validated across all commands
- [x] Persistence mechanisms verified
- [x] Edge cases tested (missing files, partial config, etc.)
- [x] Reliability of deployment mechanism confirmed
- [x] Framework validated for future language additions
- [x] Any issues identified and resolved
