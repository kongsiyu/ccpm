# Issue #006 Work Stream Analysis

## Task: Test Configuration Deployment and Inheritance

### Overview
This task validates the `/re-init` propagation mechanism and global language inheritance system. Since this is primarily a testing task with no new code development, the work streams focus on comprehensive validation rather than parallel development.

### Work Streams

#### Stream A: `/re-init` Command Testing
- **Agent Type**: general-purpose
- **Scope**: Test `/re-init` command functionality
- **Files**:
  - `.claude/CLAUDE.md` (template)
  - `CLAUDE.md` (project root)
  - Test outputs and validation
- **Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
- **Work**:
  - Test `/re-init` command propagation
  - Validate language settings transfer from template to project
  - Test edge cases like missing/partial configurations

#### Stream B: Language Inheritance Validation
- **Agent Type**: general-purpose
- **Scope**: Test global inheritance across commands
- **Files**:
  - `.claude/rules/language-config.md`
  - Various command execution tests
  - Agent interaction validation
- **Dependencies**: None (can run in parallel with Stream A)
- **Work**:
  - Test language inheritance across all PM commands
  - Validate agent responses use correct language settings
  - Test persistence across command executions

#### Stream C: Edge Case and Reliability Testing
- **Agent Type**: general-purpose
- **Scope**: Test robustness and edge cases
- **Files**:
  - Configuration files
  - Test scenarios and validation
- **Dependencies**: None (can run in parallel)
- **Work**:
  - Test missing configuration files
  - Test partial configurations
  - Test session restart scenarios
  - Validate future language addition framework

### Execution Plan
Since this is a testing task, all streams can run in parallel as they're validating different aspects of the same system without code conflicts.

### Success Criteria
- All `/re-init` functionality working correctly
- Global inheritance mechanism validated
- Edge cases handled appropriately
- Framework ready for future language additions
