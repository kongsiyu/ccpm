# Project Brief

## Project Identity

**Project Name**: Claude Code PM (CCPM)
**Repository**: kongsiyu/ccpm (fork of automazeio/ccpm)
**License**: MIT
**Primary Language**: Multi-language (Chinese/English)

## Project Scope

### Core Mission
Transform software development workflows by enabling spec-driven development with parallel AI agent execution, using GitHub issues as the collaboration backbone.

### What CCPM Does
1. **Structured Development Workflow**: Transforms ideas into production code through PRD → Epic → Tasks → Issues → Code pipeline
2. **Parallel AI Execution**: Enables multiple AI agents to work simultaneously on different aspects of the same feature
3. **GitHub-Native Collaboration**: Uses GitHub issues and comments as the primary collaboration interface
4. **Context Preservation**: Maintains project knowledge across development sessions and team members
5. **Spec-Driven Development**: Enforces "no vibe coding" principle - every change traces back to specification

### What CCPM Doesn't Do
- **Replace GitHub**: Works with GitHub, doesn't replace it
- **Manage Infrastructure**: Focuses on development workflow, not deployment/infrastructure
- **Code Generation**: Provides workflow structure, doesn't generate code directly
- **Team Communication**: Enhances communication through GitHub, doesn't replace chat tools

## Key Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Eliminate Context Loss**: Ensure project knowledge persists across sessions and team changes
2. **Enable Parallel Development**: Allow multiple work streams on single features without conflicts
3. **Enforce Quality Standards**: Prevent "vibe coding" through mandatory specification workflow
4. **Maximize Velocity**: Achieve 3-5x faster feature delivery through parallel execution
5. **Ensure Traceability**: Maintain complete audit trail from requirements to production code

### Success Criteria
- **Development Speed**: 3-5x faster feature delivery compared to traditional workflows
- **Code Quality**: 75% reduction in post-deployment bugs
- **Context Efficiency**: 89% reduction in time lost to context switching
- **Team Adoption**: Successful usage across different team sizes and project types
- **Community Growth**: Active open-source community with regular contributions

## Target Outcomes

### For Development Teams
- **Faster Delivery**: Ship features significantly faster through parallel AI execution
- **Higher Quality**: Reduce bugs through spec-driven development approach
- **Better Coordination**: Clear task dependencies and progress visibility
- **Reduced Overhead**: Less time spent on project management, more on development

### For Project Managers
- **Complete Visibility**: Real-time progress tracking through GitHub integration
- **Requirements Traceability**: Full audit trail from PRD to production code
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Clear progress updates and deliverable status
- **Risk Reduction**: Early identification of blockers and dependencies

### For Organizations
- **Process Standardization**: Consistent development workflow across teams
- **Quality Improvements**: Higher code quality through structured approach
- **Knowledge Retention**: Persistent project knowledge independent of team changes
- **Scalable Growth**: Workflow that scales with team and project growth

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **GitHub Dependency**: Requires GitHub for collaboration features
- **Git Requirement**: Must work within Git workflow paradigms
- **Shell Compatibility**: Requires bash-compatible shell environment
- **CLI Tools**: Depends on GitHub CLI and related extensions

### Organizational Constraints
- **Open Source**: Must maintain open-source compatibility and community focus
- **Existing Workflows**: Must integrate with existing development workflows
- **Learning Curve**: Must be learnable without extensive training
- **Resource Requirements**: Must run on standard development environments

### Design Constraints
- **Language Agnostic**: Must work regardless of project programming language
- **Platform Independent**: Must support Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Keep external dependencies to minimum
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility across versions

## Project Boundaries

### In Scope
- **Development Workflow**: PRD creation, epic planning, task decomposition, execution tracking
- **GitHub Integration**: Issue management, progress tracking, team collaboration
- **Agent Coordination**: Parallel AI agent execution and coordination
- **Context Management**: Project knowledge preservation and loading
- **Multi-language Support**: Chinese and English documentation and interface

### Out of Scope
- **Code Generation**: Direct AI code generation (agents handle this)
- **Deployment Automation**: CI/CD pipeline management
- **Infrastructure Management**: Server provisioning and management
- **Team Communication**: Direct messaging or chat functionality
- **Time Tracking**: Detailed time tracking and billing features

## Key Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders
1. **Development Teams**: Using AI-assisted development workflows
2. **Project Managers**: Managing complex software development projects
3. **Solo Developers**: Individual developers leveraging AI for productivity

### Secondary Stakeholders
1. **Open Source Community**: Contributors and users of the system
2. **AI Tool Vendors**: Claude Code and similar AI development tools
3. **Enterprise Organizations**: Companies adopting AI-assisted development

### Supporting Stakeholders
1. **GitHub**: Platform provider for collaboration features
2. **Shell/CLI Ecosystem**: Bash, GitHub CLI, and related tools
3. **Documentation Community**: Contributors to documentation and guides

## Risk Factors

### Technical Risks
- **API Changes**: GitHub API or CLI changes breaking functionality
- **Performance Issues**: Scalability problems with large projects or teams
- **Integration Complexity**: Difficulty integrating with diverse development environments

### Adoption Risks
- **Learning Curve**: Users finding the workflow too complex or different
- **Tool Fatigue**: Resistance to adopting another development tool
- **Ecosystem Changes**: Changes in AI coding tool landscape affecting relevance

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Robust Testing**: Comprehensive testing of GitHub integrations
- **Flexible Architecture**: Modular design allowing adaptation to changes
- **Clear Documentation**: Extensive documentation and examples
- **Community Engagement**: Active community support and feedback collection

## Success Measurements

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Development Velocity**: Time from PRD to production deployment
- **Bug Reduction**: Post-deployment defect rates
- **Context Efficiency**: Time spent on context recreation
- **User Adoption**: Installation and active usage statistics
- **Community Health**: GitHub stars, forks, issues, pull requests

### Qualitative Metrics
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on workflow improvement
- **Team Collaboration**: Quality of team coordination and communication
- **Code Quality**: Maintainability and architecture quality improvements
- **Knowledge Retention**: Effectiveness of context preservation
- **Process Standardization**: Consistency across teams and projects

## Long-term Vision
Establish CCPM as the standard workflow for AI-assisted software development, enabling teams worldwide to ship higher quality software faster through structured, collaborative, and traceable development processes.
